#!/usr/bin/env bash
# pr-review-audit.sh — list open PRs that have no review comment, and branches
# with no PR at all.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. CLAUDE.md requires every PR to get a complete review posted as
# a comment. In the session that wrote that rule, two PRs were opened without one
# and a third branch never got a PR — because "remember to review it" is not a
# mechanism. This is the mechanism: it is checkable, so it can be run before
# claiming the work is done.
#
#   ./scripts/pr-review-audit.sh          # report; exits non-zero if anything is missing
#
# A "review" is a PR comment whose body starts with "## Review". That convention
# is what makes reviews findable later, which is the whole point of putting them
# on the PR rather than in a chat log.
