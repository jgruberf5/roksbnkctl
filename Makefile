# build-integration-tags: compile-check the whole tree under the
# `integration` build tag without executing any tests. Closes the
# gap where `internal/exec/*_integration_test.go` files compiled fine
# on `go test ./...` (which skips integration-tagged files) but broke
# under `go test -tags integration ./...`. Running the build alone is
# faster than the full integration test sweep and catches the same
# shape of compile-time gap (unused imports, undefined symbols behind
# the tag, drift between the production code and the tag-gated test
# code).
build-integration-tags:

# release: full release-prep driver. Run before `git tag vX.Y.Z` to verify
# every release artifact builds cleanly. Steps:
#
#   1. Stamp today's date into CHANGELOG.md's vX.Y.Z placeholder
#   2. Run staticcheck ./... (pre-tag gate)
#   3. Compile-check under -tags integration (pre-tag gate)
#   4. Lint .goreleaser.yml via docker
#   5. Cross-compile snapshot build via goreleaser docker (writes dist/)
#
# Steps 2 + 3 catch the shape of gap where staticcheck-clean or
# -tags integration compile failures slip between tags. Running them
# locally before the tag commit means the integrator finds the breakage
# before goreleaser publishes the binaries, not after.
#
# After this completes successfully, the integrator's tag-cut sequence is:
#
#   git add -A && git commit -m "chore: prep vX.Y.Z release"
#   git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin main --tags
#
# Pushing the tag triggers .github/workflows/release.yml (goreleaser
# builds the multi-platform binaries and publishes the GitHub Release).
