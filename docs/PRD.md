# roksctl — Product Requirements Document

> **Status:** Draft v0.2 · 2026-05-08
> **Owner:** John Gruber (j.gruber@f5.com)

## TL;DR

`roksctl` is a single Go binary that deploys F5 BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes (BNK) onto an IBM Cloud Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS) cluster, manages the IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) supply chain (instances, buckets, keyed objects) BNK depends on, and validates the deployment with built-in connectivity, DNS, and throughput tests. It replaces the current `bnk` bash-script-plus-docker-runner with a cross-platform, install-once, run-anywhere CLI in the kubectl tradition.

The Terraform that does the actual provisioning continues to live in its own repo (`ibmcloud_terraform_bigip_next_for_kubernetes_2_3`) and remains the source of truth for the cluster + BNK deployment. `roksctl` is an orchestrator, a supply-chain manager, and a test harness; it does not author Terraform. All IBM Cloud calls go through the official Go SDKs — no `ibmcloud` CLI dependency at runtime.

## Problem

The current `bnk` tool gets the job done but its shape produces recurring friction:

- **Docker-as-runtime**: every command spins a container. Slow on cold start, fragile on Windows/WSL, and the bash + busybox + bind-mount layering produced a cascade of bugs (`cp -n` semantics, `set -u` unbound vars, `/opt/tf-project` ownership) over the last few releases.
- **Bash inside the runner**: ~1100 lines of orchestration in shell. Hard to test, hard to refactor, easy to break across busybox/GNU differences.
- **No testing surface**: validating a BNK deployment after `bnk apply` is a manual exercise — `kubectl get pods`, `curl` from a jumpbox, eyeball the throughput numbers. Customers and SEs ask "is this working?" and we have no machine answer.
- **Distribution**: requires Docker installed and running. Excludes Windows users without WSL, complicates air-gapped customer environments.

## Goals

1. **One binary, three commands**: `roksctl init`, `roksctl up`, `roksctl test` covers the 90% path.
2. **Drive the existing Terraform unchanged.** The TF modules in `ibmcloud_terraform_bigip_next_for_kubernetes_2_3` continue to be developed, versioned, and released independently; `roksctl` consumes them via a pinned source URL.
3. **Built-in deployment validation.** Connectivity (curl), DNS (dig), and throughput (iperf3) tests ship with the tool, run against the just-deployed BNK, and produce structured pass/fail output.
4. **Cross-platform.** Linux, macOS, Windows (native, no WSL required). Single statically-linked binary.
5. **Sensible defaults, escape hatches everywhere.** Simple users never see a flag; power users can override anything.
6. **Idempotent and resumable.** Re-running `roksctl up` after a partial failure picks up where it left off — same as `terraform apply` already does.
7. **Manage the COS supply chain.** First-class commands to create/delete COS instances and buckets, and to put/get/delete/list keyed objects. The customer goes from "I have an API key" to "deployed BNK" with no console clicks for the prerequisite artifacts BNK needs (FAR pull keys, JWT licenses, future per-tenant config).

## Non-goals

- **Not a Terraform IDE / authoring tool.** TF is written and tested in the TF repo. `roksctl` is consumer-side.
- **Not a general-purpose IBM Cloud CLI.** `ibmcloud` exists for that. `roksctl`'s scope on IBM Cloud is the BNK supply chain — ROKS for the cluster, COS for prerequisite artifacts, IAM for what BNK consumes — not Code Engine, Satellite, IKS, Watson, etc.
- **Not a general-purpose Kubernetes CLI.** `kubectl` and `oc` exist for that; `roksctl shell` drops into a context where they Just Work.
- **Not an arbitrary workload deployer.** BNK is the workload; iperf3 / nginx test fixtures are deployed only in service of testing.
- **Not a replacement for `terraform plan`/`apply` for TF developers.** They keep using terraform directly against the TF repo.

## Target users

| Persona | Use case | Sophistication |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| F5 SE / pre-sales | Spin up a demo BNK environment on IBM Cloud, show throughput numbers to a prospect, tear down | Knows kubectl, mostly opaque on Terraform |
| F5 product engineer | Iterate on BNK builds against a shared dev cluster | Knows TF, k8s, networking deeply |
| Customer evaluator | First-time stand-up of BNK on their IBM Cloud account | May not know kubectl, follows a runbook |
| CI / automation | Deterministic deploy + test cycle, JSON output, exit codes | Headless, no TTY |

The simplest user flow must work for the customer evaluator. Power-user flags must exist for the engineer.

## The user experience

### The 3-command happy path

```
$ roksctl init
✓ IBM Cloud API key (from $IBMCLOUD_API_KEY)
? Region [ca-tor]: us-south
? Resource group [default]:
? Create new ROKS cluster? [Y/n]: y
? Cluster name [bnk-demo]:
? Workers per zone [1]:
? OpenShift version [4.18]:
✓ Wrote ~/.roksctl/default/config.yaml

$ roksctl up
→ Validating IBM Cloud credentials      ✓ (j.gruber@f5.com, account "Main F5")
→ Resolving Terraform source            ✓ (github.com/jgruberf5/...@v0.6.7, latest at init time)
→ terraform init                        ✓
→ terraform plan: +47 / ~0 / -0
? Apply this plan? [y/N]: y
→ terraform apply                       (this will take ~25 minutes)
  ████████████████████░░░░  82%   modules/flo (helm install f5_lifecycle_operator)
✓ BNK deployed
  cluster:    bnk-demo (us-south)
  console:    https://...
  cneinstance: 1 ready, 3/3 TMM pods running

$ roksctl test
→ DNS                                   ✓ ingress.bnk-demo... resolves to 169.x.x.x
→ Connectivity                          ✓ HTTPS 200 in 184ms
→ Throughput                            ✓ 9.42 Gbit/s (iperf3, 30s, 8 streams)
✓ All tests passed (3/3)
```

Three commands. No flags. No reading docs. Output is brief but informative; verbose details available with `-v`.

### Tear-down

```
$ roksctl down
? This will destroy cluster "bnk-demo" and all BNK resources. Continue? [y/N]: y
→ terraform destroy                     ✓
✓ All resources removed
```

### Iteration loop (engineer)

```
$ roksctl plan                # read-only, what would change
$ roksctl apply               # apply without re-init prompts
$ roksctl logs flo            # tail logs of the lifecycle operator
$ roksctl shell               # drop into a cluster-context bash with kubectl/oc/ibmcloud
$ roksctl test throughput     # rerun just the perf test
```

### Multi-environment (workspaces)

Each workspace is a named, isolated config + state bundle under `~/.roksctl/<name>/`. The default workspace is `default`. Switch with `--workspace` or `-w`:

```
$ roksctl -w prod up
$ roksctl -w demo up
$ roksctl workspaces list
NAME      CLUSTER         REGION     STATE
default   bnk-demo        us-south   applied
prod      bnk-prod-1      ca-tor     applied
demo      bnk-canada      ca-tor     destroyed
```

### Pointing at a local Terraform checkout (engineer)

```
$ roksctl up --tf-source ~/code/ibmcloud_terraform_bigip_next_for_kubernetes_2_3
```

Bypasses the pinned release; uses the local working tree. Used when iterating on TF and `roksctl` together.

## The test surface in detail

The test suite ships *with* `roksctl` so that "did the deployment succeed" has a machine-readable answer.

### `roksctl test connectivity`
- Discovers the deployed BNK service endpoints from cluster state (annotations on the CNEInstance / its services).
- For each endpoint, performs an HTTP GET (or HTTPS with cert validation as configured).
- Pass criteria: 2xx response within timeout, TLS handshake completes, optionally a body match.
- Implemented with Go's `net/http` — no external `curl` dependency.

### `roksctl test dns`
- Looks up the cluster ingress hostname, the BNK GSLB datacenter hostname (if configured), and any user-specified hosts in `config.yaml`.
- Verifies records resolve, A/AAAA values are sane (not 127.x.x.x, not RFC1918 unless expected).
- Implemented with Go's `net.Resolver` — no external `dig`.

### `roksctl test throughput`
- Two modes, selected via `--mode {north-south,east-west}` (default `north-south`):
  - **north-south**: deploys an `iperf3 -s` pod behind a Service that exercises BNK's data path (typically LoadBalancer / TMM VIP). Client runs on the roksctl host. This is what the demo and customer-evaluation flows care about — measures the data plane BNK is meant to accelerate.
  - **east-west**: deploys both client and server as in-cluster pods. Useful for triage ("is BNK slow, or is the cluster slow?"). `--cross-node` forces client and server onto different nodes.
- Server image is configurable (`test.throughput.image:` in `config.yaml`); default `networkstatic/iperf3:latest` (public, no F5 supply chain to manage). Customers with a mirror or F5-built image override.
- Reports peak / average throughput, retransmits, jitter.
- Tears down the iperf3 pod + service unless `--keep` is passed.
- iperf3 client binary required on PATH locally; doctor flags if missing. (Server side always runs in-cluster via the image.)

### `roksctl test all`
- Runs the three above sequentially with structured output (table by default, JSON with `-o json`).
- Exit code 0 on all-pass, 1 on any-fail. CI-friendly.

### Custom test plans (later)
A v2 feature: declarative `tests.yaml` in the workspace describing additional probes (extra hostnames, custom HTTP paths, larger iperf3 durations).

## Configuration

### Per-workspace config
File: `~/.roksctl/<workspace>/config.yaml`

```yaml
ibmcloud:
  region: us-south
  resource_group: default
  api_key_source: env  # env | keychain | prompt
cluster:
  create: true
  name: bnk-demo
  openshift_version: "4.18"
  workers_per_zone: 1
bnk:
  cneinstance_size: Small
  far_repo_url: repo.f5.com
  manifest_version: "2.3.0-..."
  # ... only the fields a customer would actually edit
test:
  throughput:
    image: networkstatic/iperf3:latest   # override with a mirror or F5-built image
    duration: 30
    streams: 8
    default_mode: north-south            # or east-west
  connectivity:
    extra_hosts: []
tf_source:
  type: github
  repo: jgruberf5/ibmcloud_terraform_bigip_next_for_kubernetes_2_3
  ref: v0.6.7   # resolved at init time from latest release; bump with `roksctl init --upgrade-tf`

# Optional, future (see "Out-of-scope for v1"). v1 ships the primitives via
# `roksctl cos object put …`; this block is the eventual auto-orchestration shape.
# cos:
#   instance: bnk-orchestration
#   bucket: bnk-schematics-resources
#   upload:
#     - source: ./pull-keys/non-ga-prod-pull-key.tgz
#       key: non-ga-prod-pull-key.tgz
#     - source: ./licenses/test-terraform.jwt
#       key: test-terraform.jwt
```

`roksctl init` produces this file via interactive prompts. Sensible defaults are picked for everything; users only see prompts for unavoidable choices (region, cluster name, create-new-or-attach).

### Global config
File: `~/.roksctl/config.yaml` — non-secret defaults (default workspace, telemetry on/off, color/output preferences).

### State
Directory: `~/.roksctl/<workspace>/state/`
- `terraform.tfstate` (driven by hashicorp/terraform-exec)
- `kubeconfig`
- `scratch/` (transient downloads, FAR tarballs, kubeconfigs fetched via the IBM container-services SDK)

State location is fixed per workspace and not user-relocatable in v1 (kept simple). v2 may add remote state backends.

### Secrets

API key resolution order, all in v1:

1. `IBMCLOUD_API_KEY` env var — honored without prompting.
2. OS keychain (per-workspace entry: `roksctl/<workspace>/ibmcloud_api_key`):
   - macOS: Keychain via `zalando/go-keyring`.
   - Linux: libsecret via `zalando/go-keyring` (gnome-keyring, kwallet, KeePassXC, etc.).
   - Windows: Credential Manager via `zalando/go-keyring`.
3. Interactive prompt (only on TTY) — offers to save to keychain after.
4. Hard error.

Plaintext in `config.yaml` is rejected at load time. `--api-key-from {env|keychain|prompt}` pins the source for one invocation.

## Terraform integration

- **Source**: pinned to a release tag of the TF repo by default. Resolved at `roksctl init` time and persisted in `config.yaml`'s `tf_source` block. Re-run `roksctl init --upgrade-tf` (or edit the file) to bump.
- **Driver**: `hashicorp/terraform-exec` Go library wraps the `terraform` binary. Streams plan/apply progress to roksctl's UI.
- **Terraform binary**: required on PATH. `roksctl doctor` reports the version and a clear install hint if missing. (v2 may auto-install via `hashicorp/hc-install` into `~/.roksctl/bin/`.)
- **Module fetching**: `terraform init` handles it. `roksctl` does no source resolution itself beyond writing the right `source = "..."` for the root module.
- **Variables**: roksctl translates `config.yaml` into `terraform.tfvars` in the workspace state dir before each apply. Users do not edit `terraform.tfvars` directly; the file is treated as build output.

## IBM Cloud integration

- **Approach**: Go SDKs only. `roksctl` does not shell out to the `ibmcloud` CLI for any of its operations — `ibmcloud` is not a runtime dependency. (Users can still install it; `roksctl shell` will load credentials so it works.)
- **SDKs**:
  - [`IBM/platform-services-go-sdk`](https://github.com/IBM/platform-services-go-sdk) — IAM (auth verification, identity), Resource Controller (COS instance CRUD, generic resource lookup), Resource Manager (resource group resolution).
  - [`IBM/container-services-go-sdk`](https://github.com/IBM/container-services-go-sdk) — IKS / ROKS cluster config download, cluster status.
  - [`IBM/ibm-cos-sdk-go`](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cos-sdk-go) — COS bucket and object I/O. S3-compatible (literally a fork of the AWS S3 SDK with IBM auth bolted in); handles multipart uploads, streaming downloads, retries.
- **Why not the CLI**: avoids the plugin / state / version-drift class of bugs that consumed v0.6.4 – v0.6.6 (plugins not visible to non-root user, busybox `cp -n` breaking the seed, deprecation banners on every login). Output parsing is brittle. Binary I/O via shell-out is awkward (multipart, progress, streaming). SDKs add ~5 – 10 MB to the binary, well within the < 30 MB budget.
- **Auth model**: API key (env or workspace) → IAM bearer. COS uses IAM bearer auth by default; HMAC keys are an opt-in for users wiring third-party S3-compatible tooling at the same buckets.

## External dependencies at runtime

| Tool | Required for | If missing |
|------|--------------|------------|
| `terraform` | All deploy operations | doctor reports + clear install hint |
| `iperf3` (client) | `roksctl test throughput` | doctor reports; throughput skipped, others run |
| `oc` (optional) | `roksctl shell --oc` (preferred shell mode) | falls back to kubectl |
| `kubectl` (optional) | `roksctl shell --kubectl` | bundled client-go covers most ops |
| `ibmcloud` | **not required at runtime** | roksctl uses Go SDKs (`platform-services-go-sdk`, `container-services-go-sdk`, `ibm-cos-sdk-go`) for everything it does on IBM Cloud — auth, cluster config, COS instance/bucket/object I/O |

`roksctl shell` deserves a note: when a user wants a real interactive shell with full IBM Cloud + OpenShift CLIs, those CLIs do need to be installed on the host. `roksctl shell` doesn't bundle them, but it does set `KUBECONFIG`, `IBMCLOUD_API_KEY`, etc. correctly so that whichever CLIs the user has installed Just Work.

## Distribution

- **Releases**: GitHub Releases via goreleaser. Cross-compiled to `linux/{amd64,arm64}`, `darwin/{amd64,arm64}`, `windows/{amd64,arm64}`.
- **Install methods**:
  - `brew install jgruberf5/tap/roksctl` (homebrew tap)
  - `scoop install roksctl` (Windows)
  - `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash` (mirrors current bnk pattern)
  - `go install github.com/jgruberf5/roksctl/cmd/roksctl@latest` (Go users)
- **Self-update**: `roksctl self update` downloads the latest release matching the host arch, replaces the binary in place. Optional, never automatic.
- **Binary size budget**: target < 30 MB stripped. client-go pulls weight; acceptable.

Cobra for CLI structure (kubectl-like). Bubbletea or simpler for the progress UI. zerolog or slog for structured logs.

## Out-of-scope for v1, on the radar for v2

- Remote Terraform state backends (S3, COS, Terraform Cloud)
- Custom test plan files (`tests.yaml`)
- Auto-install of terraform binary into `~/.roksctl/bin/`
- Multi-cluster workspaces (one workspace = many clusters)
- Telemetry / opt-in usage analytics
- A web UI / TUI dashboard
- Plugin model (`roksctl plugin install <thing>`)
- Auto-upload of FAR pull key + JWT from local files via a `cos.upload:` block in `config.yaml` — `roksctl up` orchestrating the COS supply chain end-to-end. v1 ships the primitives (`roksctl cos object put …`); the orchestration glue follows once usage patterns settle.
- HMAC keys for COS auth (v1 uses IAM bearer; HMAC opt-in for third-party S3 tooling against the same buckets).
- Air-gapped install bundle (binary + terraform + container images in one tarball)

## Open questions

1. **Failure recovery**: when `terraform apply` fails halfway, `roksctl up` re-runs apply transparently. But what about logical failure modes — pods crash-looping, CRD not ready — that don't surface in TF? `roksctl status` should detect these; do we surface them as deploy-time failures, or only when `roksctl test` runs?
2. **What does `roksctl` do when the TF repo's contract changes** (new required variable in some future tag)? `roksctl init --upgrade-tf` re-prompts for any new fields; old config without them gets a clear error pointing at the new key. Worth a small RFC.
3. **`roksctl up` and the COS supply chain**: should `up` (driven by a `cos:` block in `config.yaml`) auto-create the COS instance + bucket and auto-upload the FAR pull key + JWT, or keep that as an explicit prerequisite via `roksctl cos …` commands? v1 has the primitives either way; the question is whether the 3-command happy path includes COS prep or assumes it's been done.
4. **`roksctl status` shape**: what fields and how deep? Cluster + namespace + component status is the minimum; should it also probe BNK CRDs (CNEInstance.status, License.status), or stop at "are the pods healthy"?

## Success metrics

- Customer evaluator can go from `curl install.sh` to passing `roksctl test` on a fresh laptop in < 35 minutes (most of which is waiting for ROKS to provision).
- F5 SE can spin up a demo, run throughput, tear down, and have all artefacts gone in 3 commands.
- Number of GitHub issues citing busybox / docker / WSL trends to zero (compared with bnk's recent v0.6.x release cadence).
